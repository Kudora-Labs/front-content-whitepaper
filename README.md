# front-content-whitepaper

This project powers the front-end content for the Kudora whitepaper. The main index page dynamically generates a sidebar navigation based on the document structure, allowing users to easily browse sections and subsections. The sidebar highlights the current section and supports collapsible navigation for nested headings.

## Markdown File Format

- Use standard Markdown syntax for headings, lists, code blocks, tables, and other elements.
- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) are used to build the sidebar navigation automatically:
  - `#` for the main title (appears at the top)
  - `##` for main sections (sidebar top-level)
  - `###` for subsections (nested under sections)
- Keep content organized and use headings consistently for best navigation results.
- You can include images, links, blockquotes, and other Markdown features as needed.
