# Token & Economics

At the core of Kudora lies **Kudos** — a token designed not for speculation, but for **recognition**.  
Kudos embodies the principle that **value is created by contribution**.  
Every action that strengthens the ecosystem — building, supporting, teaching, investing, or curating — is rewarded with Kudos.

## Kudos as Recognition

### The Philosophy
Traditional tokens measure **capital**. Kudos measures **contribution**.  
It transforms recognition from an afterthought into the **primary unit of value**.  

### How It Works
- Builders earn Kudos by contributing code, designs, products, or services.  
- Experts earn Kudos by curating, mentoring, or validating.  
- Communities earn Kudos by engaging, spreading trust, and supporting growth.  
- Investors earn Kudos not just for money, but for **active, meaningful participation**.  

Kudos becomes your **on-chain reputation**: a badge of what you have added to the ecosystem.

## Tokenomics Principles

Kudos is guided by a design that prioritizes **fairness, sustainability, and utility**.  

### Core Principles
- **Fixed Supply + Inflationary Rewards**  
  Initial supply is fixed, but validator-based inflation ensures fair distribution at the beginning.  
- **Gradual Transition**  
  Early inflation fades as the ecosystem matures, replaced by recognition-driven rewards (e.g., staking, NFT mechanisms).  
- **Anti-Whale Design**  
  No single entity should control the currency of recognition. Mechanisms prevent accumulation without contribution.  
- **Utility-First**  
  Kudos is not a speculative asset — its core value is in **participation, access, and recognition**.  

### Distribution Philosophy
- **Validators & Stakers**: Sustain the chain while keeping it secure.  
- **Builders & Contributors**: Receive a continuous flow of recognition.  
- **Community Pools**: Fund collective initiatives, projects, and experiments.  
- **DAO Treasury**: Ensure long-term governance and development.

## Utility of Kudos

Kudos is not just symbolic — it has tangible roles in the ecosystem.  

### Recognition & Reputation
- Track contributions across projects.  
- Build verifiable, on-chain reputations.  
- Turn recognition into trust that lasts.  

### Governance
- Kudos gives voice in **EthicDAO**.  
- The more recognition you’ve earned, the more weight your vote carries.  
- Governance power flows from **what you give**, not just **what you hold**.  

### Access & Rewards
- Staking Kudos provides access to ecosystem services.  
- Projects can distribute Kudos to incentivize adoption and loyalty.  
- NFT staking and reputation-based rewards unlock new ways to grow.  

### Economic Layer
- Kudos is the **fuel for collaboration**: payments, access rights, and cross-project exchanges.  
- A medium of exchange for services, expertise, and participation within Kudora.
